## Inspiration
we intend to make a smart home without troubling our users by forcing them to install an application. So we utilize the popular social media messenger such as facebook that we're sure is owned by majority of people. By using popular social media messenger, user just need to access our app trough their social media app that is already in their gadget.
## What it does
This bot enables user to control their electronic devices from afar just by sending message through social media messenger.
## How we built it
We use messenger platfrom from facebook to receive command/message from user. After the message is received, then the message is forwarded into wit.ai to be recognized
## Challenges we ran into
To make a dynamic bot, it requires a large dataset for the training. With limited time and resources, we were not able to achieve that. Also, because of limited hardware, we were only using LED for the demo.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This project has been tested and was able to function like we intended to. It was able to control a lamp by using both text message and voice note.
## What we learned
In this project we learn how to use git with team, How to use api, and how to integrate messenger with wit.ai.
## What's next for ghiscure
In the future this chat bot will operate more dynamically. this bot will have additional features, not only turning on or off the electronic devices.
